# Trading SOP Journal — Vision

This project exists for one reason:  
To turn every trading session into an honest, data-backed, emotion-aware feedback loop that makes you a better operator — not tomorrow, but today.

Most journaling tools are either bloated, too generic, or built for people who want pretty charts instead of accountability. This one is different. This one is personal. It mirrors how a disciplined trader actually thinks: levels, bias, setups, emotions, mistakes, wins, and the story behind the day.

## What This Tool Actually Is
A clean, no-bullshit trading session companion that:

- Helps you prepare your mind and your levels pre-market  
- Tracks the live session with precision  
- Logs trades and missed trades with full context  
- Captures emotions without judgement  
- Generates a tight, readable session report  
- Evolves with you as your strategy evolves  

It’s not meant to look cool; it’s meant to make you sharper.

## Who It’s For
Someone who trades from intention, not impulsiveness.  
Someone who wants to see improvement they can **measure**, not just “feel.”

Basically: someone like me.

## What Makes It Different
- Built around **my actual strategy**, not generic indicators  
- Tracks emotional triggers in the same breath as R-multiples  
- Integrates IF–THEN planning into trade tagging  
- Captures behaviour escalation and recovery  
- Treats missed trades as seriously as executed ones  
- Produces a **clean PDF summary**, not a screenshot dump  
- Gives you clarity without overwhelming you

## Long-Term Direction
Keep the core simple but powerful.  
Then layer the following when needed:

- Automatic pattern detection  
- AI emotional coaching  
- AI trade review summaries  
- Statistical analysis of habits and performance  
- Session archetype detection  
- Bias accuracy tracking  
- Replay mode w/ annotated screenshots  

But this is long-term.  
The vision is to build a tool that grows with me, not ahead of me.

## Design Principles
1. **Honesty over aesthetics.**  
   If the tool doesn’t make me brutally honest with myself, what’s the point?

2. **Low friction, high clarity.**  
   Every field must matter — no vanity inputs.

3. **Sessions tell stories.**  
   The PDF should feel like the *narrative of the day*, not a dump of data.

4. **Emotions matter.**  
   The tool must capture when *my brain, not the market*, caused the loss.

5. **Strategy-aware.**  
   Built around:
   - Key levels  
   - NY impulse  
   - Setup categories (Reversal, B+R, Pullback Continuation)  
   - Confluence stacking  
   - Risk models  

6. **No overengineering.**  
   Keep it light. Keep it clean. Keep it yours.

This is not a corporate product.  
This is a weapon for self-improvement.
