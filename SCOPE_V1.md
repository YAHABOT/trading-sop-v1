# Trading SOP Journal — V1 Scope (Muscle Memory Edition)

This document defines the boundaries of Version 1, the real-world feedback loop through which it evolves, and the first foundational step required to turn strategy execution into automatic “pencil reflex” behavior.

V1 is not a fixed feature list —  
it is a live prototype that sharpens itself through daily use.

# ⭐ Priority #1 — Identify the Fields Required for Automatic Execution

Before ANY V1 feature work, UI upgrades, database work, or PDF polishing,  
the FIRST objective of this project is:

### 1. Identify the exact behaviors that must be measured  
to understand:
- why I hesitate  
- why I miss valid setups  
- why I avoid risk  
- why I overtrade  
- what breaks my A-game  
- what supports my A-game  
- what emotions block execution  
- what emotions amplify execution  
- and what must be tracked to turn trading into **muscle memory**

### 2. Compare those behavior-critical fields  
with the fields the journal is currently tracking.

### 3. Decide:
- what needs to be **added**  
- what needs to be **removed**  
- what needs to be **refined or replaced**

### 4. Ensure the journal captures EVERYTHING  
required to evolve from deliberate execution → **automatic execution**,  
the same effortless naturalness as a baby picking up a pencil.

This **behavioral field audit** is Step 0 and must happen BEFORE  
finalizing the V1 structure.

# 🎯 V1 Core Goals

1. Provide a fast, structured, no-BS way to journal a full trading session.
2. Capture all fields necessary to move my strategy from conscious effort → **reflex**.
3. Track:
   - Pre-market preparation  
   - Live execution (trades + missed trades)  
   - Post-market reflection  
4. Generate a clean, structured PDF that tells the real story of the day.
5. Evolve through daily real-world usage — no theoretical design, only practical improvements.

# 🧪 How V1 Will Be Built

V1 evolves through actual trading:

1. Use the journal live  
2. Notice friction, missing fields, or unnecessary fields  
3. Report the issues  
4. The UI, PDF, scoring, and workflow get refined  
5. Iterate until journaling becomes natural & effortless  

The journal becomes the external mirror that reveals:  
**what I do**, **what I avoid**, and **what needs calibration**.

V1 ends when the tool feels like a natural extension of my trading process.

- Execution score  
- Emotional stability  
- Process integrity  
- Overall rating (A–F)
- Session summary
- Emotional review
- Behavior patterns
- 3 mistakes to avoid
- 3 wins to repeat
- Focus for tomorrow

### PDF Export
- Clean structured PDF (NOT screenshots)
- Only include fields with data
- Organized section flow
- Trades & missed trades summarized
- Confluences, emotions, IF–THEN included
- Screenshot thumbnails (optional)

---

# 🟡 SHOULD-HAVE Features (Added Through Usage)

Added only if live sessions reveal the need:

- Better confluence groupings
- Cleaner tagging UX
- More intuitive collapsibles
- Scoring model adjustments
- Thumbnail previews
- Session archetype labeling (trend/range/reversal)
- Low-friction UI optimizations

---

# ⚪ NICE-TO-HAVE Features

If they are easy, we add:
- Emotion color indicators
- Dropdown presets
- Confluence favorites
- UI/UX polish
- Light/Dark PDF themes

# ❌ Out of Scope for V1  
### (Including new addition: **TradeZella Audit for Advanced Stats Dashboard**)

These belong to V1.5 → V2 and WILL NOT be built in V1:

- Full backend (Supabase integration)
- Historical session storage
- Stats dashboard
- Setup accuracy analytics
- Journaling analytics engine
- AI trade summaries
- AI emotional pattern detection
- Screenshot parsing / automatic tagging
- Auto-categorization of setups
- Multi-user system
- Authentication
- Cloud sync
- Mobile app
- Screenshot annotation

## 🚨 NEW OUT-OF-SCOPE ADDITION:
### **Advanced Stats Dashboard (TradeZella-Inspired)**

Before building any analytics:

1. We will perform a **full audit** of TradeZella  
   (features, UX, stats, insights, behavioral metrics).
2. Identify which features genuinely help MY workflow.
3. Discard the ones that don’t serve automatic execution.
4. Adopt, adapt, or improve only the parts that add value.
5. Define a custom analytics layer built specifically around:
   - Execution consistency  
   - Missed R opportunities  
   - Emotional pattern tracking  
   - Confluence reliability  
   - Setup performance  
   - A-game vs non-A-game sessions  

This is a MAJOR project — and must NOT be done in V1.  
It begins after the core journal is stable.

# 🧭 How V1 Ends (Definition of Done)

V1 is complete when:

1. The behavioral field audit is complete  
2. All necessary fields for automaticity are defined  
3. The tool feels natural and frictionless during live usage  
4. The PDF accurately tells the story of performance and mindset  
5. No major workflow friction remains  
6. Execution patterns (good and bad) become obvious  
7. Missed setups and emotional loops are visible  
8. The journal supports progressive **muscle memory development**  
9. The structure stabilizes and improvements naturally slow down

At that point, we enter V1.5 and begin backend + analytics evolution.
