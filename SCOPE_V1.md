# Trading SOP Journal — V1 Scope (Live Testing Edition)

This document defines the practical boundaries of Version 1:

- What the tool MUST do from the start  
- What it SHOULD evolve into during real-world use  
- What is intentionally left for later  
- How we iterate (feedback loop based on live sessions)

V1 is **not** a frozen feature list — it’s a working prototype that improves through daily use.

# 🎯 V1 Core Goals

1. Provide a **fast, structured**, no-BS way to journal a full trading session  
2. Cover the essential fields for:
   - Pre-market preparation  
   - Live session (trades + missed trades)  
   - Post-market reflection  
3. Generate a **clean structured PDF**  
4. Be **easy enough** to use every day without friction  
5. Evolve through real-world feedback (not theory)

# 🧪 How V1 Will Actually Be Built

**We do not guess features.**  
V1 grows through the daily trading experience:

1. Use the tool live  
2. Notice friction / missing fields / unnecessary fields  
3. Report it  
4. I fix it within the scope of V1  
5. PDF, UI, scoring, workflow — all get tightened over time

V1 = evolving prototype → refined until it feels “natural.”

# 🧭 How V1 Ends

V1 is “done” when:

1. The tool feels natural during live trading  
2. The PDF captures the day clearly  
3. No major workflow friction remains  
4. All essential psychological & technical elements are covered  
5. The system is reliable and predictable  
6. Improvements slow down because the structure feels right

This is the “prototype → stable version” moment.
