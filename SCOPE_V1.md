# Trading SOP Journal — V1 Scope (Muscle Memory Edition)

This document defines the boundaries of Version 1, the real-world feedback loop through which it evolves, 
and the foundational step required to turn strategy execution into automatic “pencil reflex” behavior.

V1 is a live prototype.  
It sharpens itself through real usage, not theoretical planning.

# ⭐ PRIORITY #1 — Automaticity Field Audit

Before ANY development, UI changes, or backend work, the first mandatory outcome is:

1. Identify every behavior required to understand:
   - why I hesitate
   - why I miss valid setups
   - why I avoid risk
   - why I overtrade
   - what breaks A-Game
   - what supports A-Game
   - what emotions block execution
   - what emotions amplify execution
   - what must be tracked to make execution automatic

2. Compare required behavioral fields with what the journal currently tracks.

3. Decide:
   - what needs to be added
   - what needs to be removed
   - what needs to be refined or replaced

This audit defines the V1 skeleton.

# 🎯 V1 Core Philosophy

The journal is built to reveal:
- hesitation patterns
- emotional spikes
- behavior loops
- broken discipline moments
- A-Game behaviors
- execution consistency

And to do it in the simplest possible structure —  
no clutter, no noise, only what builds muscle memory.

# 🧪 How V1 Will Be Used

V1 evolves **during live trading**:

1. Fill journal progressively across the session  
2. Journal reacts to what actually happens (trades + missed trades)  
3. Identify missing fields or friction  
4. Update SCOPE + UI accordingly  

V1 ends when journaling becomes **effortless and reflexive**.
